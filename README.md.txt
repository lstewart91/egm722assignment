Setup and installation 

Setting up Git/Downloading Repository 

Git is a revision control system that allows the ability to store and traverse software versions, allowing the user to switch between revisions of data (Salis and Spinellis 2019).
To begin, a git account must be created. This can be completed with the following link https://github.com. Once this step has been completed, use the following link to access the repository containing all the necessary data: https://github.com/lstewart91/egm722assignment.

If the user still needs to, the user may be asked to sign in from this link. The repository should now appear, and a section with a green label called code should be visible click on this and select Download the zip file; this should be extracted in a location the user can recall for later. 

Setting up Anaconda and Environment 

To install Anaconda, use the following link https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/  and select the corresponding operating system.

Once this is installed, open Anaconda Navigator from the desktop; a new environment will be created here. Then, on the left-hand side, select Environments and navigate to import.

A new window will appear, allowing the user to navigate to the local file where the user saves the git repository and select Belfast Lough Environment.yml, which contains the following main dependencies python, pandas and Folium. 

The user can then select a name for the environment and click import. The user can then return to environments; at the top, there is a drop-down menu allowing the user to change to the environment that was just created. 

Next, a select number of apps will appear; the following apps need to be downloaded, CMD.exe Prompt and Jupyter Notebook. 

Once completed, the user can open CMD.exe Prompt and insert the following code jupyter-notebook; this will navigate the user to jupyter notebook, where the user can navigate to the downloaded repository and open the script Belfast Lough script. The script will then open, and the user can run the script.
